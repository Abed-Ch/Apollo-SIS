Apollo SIS (Student Information System)

This was my senior project for graduating from LIU, and It was my first time ever doing anything related to web programming, but i learned and did alot during those 3 months and im proud of what i wrote (Although Outdated).

The project is a school system that has a index page, dashboard, login page, assignments page, notifications system (in app), Schedule page (for classes) , A library and a blogs page.

Some pages are diffrent for teachers and students so they have diffrent files ( i didnt know i can make them in one page at the time ....sry)

my best work would be the library and blogs (mainly the javascript files -> over 1k lines )

----------

What i used :

HTML

CSS

JAVASCRIPT

FIREBASE

evo calander

-----------

The app is hosted on firebase although it might not work as firebase (firestore) security rules havent been maintained because it is not public ( no users ).
